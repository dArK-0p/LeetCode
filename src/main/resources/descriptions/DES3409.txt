You are given an array of integers nums.

Your task is to find the length of the longest subsequence seq of nums, such that
the absolute differences between consecutive elements form a non-increasing sequence of integers.

In other words, for a subsequence seq0, seq1, seq2, ..., seqm of nums,
|seq1 - seq0| >= |seq2 - seq1| >= ... >= |seqm - seqm - 1|.

Return the length of such a subsequence.
